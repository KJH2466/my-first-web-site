<h2>Law of Universal Gravity</h2>
<img src="331.jpg" width="50%">
<p>Newton's <strong>law of universal gravitation</strong> is usually stated as that every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle" target="_blank">particle</a> attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.[note 1] The publication of the theory has become known as the "first great unification", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("the Principia"), first published on 5 July 1687. When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him.</p>
