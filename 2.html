<h2>Big Bang</h2>
<img src="221.jpg" width="50%">
<p>The <strong>Big Bang</strong> event is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theory" target="_blank">physical theory</a> that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models of the <strong>Big Bang</strong> explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the Universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the <strong>Big Bang</strong>.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Crucially, these models are compatible with Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named "the <strong>Big Bang</strong> singularity"). In 1964 the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified, since the <strong>Big Bang</strong> predicted a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the <strong>Big Bang</strong>, which is now essentially universally accepted. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the <strong>Big Bang</strong> singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe.</p>
