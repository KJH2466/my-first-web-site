<h2>Hawking Radiation</h2>
<img src="3344.png" width="50%">
<p><strong>Hawking radiation</strong> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black body radiation</a> that is theorized to be released outside a black hole's event horizon because of relativistic quantum effects. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who developed a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974. <strong>Hawking radiation</strong> is a purely kinematic effect that is generic to Lorentzian geometries containing event horizons or local apparent horizons.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong>Hawking radiation</strong> reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also theorized to cause black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that do not gain mass through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. For all except the smallest black holes, this would happen extremely slowly. The radiation temperature is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, so micro black holes are predicted to be larger emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should dissipate faster.</p>
